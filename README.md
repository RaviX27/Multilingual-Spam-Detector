Project Overview
🚀 An Embeddable Multi-Language AI Model to Filter Spam Messages

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the development and deployment of our innovative spam detection system. This project is a significant step towards addressing the escalating issue of spam messages in digital communication platforms, with a focus on English, Sinhala, and Singlish languages.

Key Findings
🎯 Data Collection and Model Development
In tackling the challenge of diverse datasets, we successfully implemented the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm for spam detection. The accuracy rates of 76% for Sinhala and an impressive 97% for English highlight the effectiveness of our chosen algorithm. While achieving notable success, ongoing enhancements are within our scope for continuous improvement.

🔄 Singlish to Sinhala Conversion
Handling Singlish messages presented unique challenges, met with a customized open-source converter. Our system's capability to seamlessly remove and reintegrate phone numbers and links during the conversion process enhances user experience and preserves message integrity.

📱 Mobile App and API Development
The creation of an Android mobile app with a user-friendly interface amplifies the system's accessibility. Users can effortlessly input messages and receive prompt classification results. Our Flask API development plays a pivotal role, integrating language models and the Singlish to Sinhala converter. The inclusion of language detection logic ensures accurate message routing to the appropriate model.

🧪 Software Testing Process
Our rigorous testing process, encompassing unit testing, integration testing, user interface testing, system testing, performance testing, and user acceptance testing, was instrumental in verifying the system's accuracy, functionality, and scalability. This meticulous approach ensures a robust and reliable solution.
